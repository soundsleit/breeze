A breeze brings... : by Scott Smallwood

For this piece, there are three different "instruments" that can be played.  Chuck breeze.ck in the terminal, and it will ask you to choose a player.  It is best to simply spread out the number of players among the group, having roughly an equal number of each.

The piece should simply be played as a very slow swell from nothing to full volume (never too loud), and back to silence.  The interface encourages slow actions.  There are also some other controls for changing overall brightness, tempo, and density.  These should be used sparingly and very carefully.

For six-channel operation, type

chuck -c6 breeze.ck
